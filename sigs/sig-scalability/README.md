# Argo SIG Scalability

Argo SIG Scalability is focused on the scalability and performance of Argo CD project.

The goals of this group are to create benchmarking tooling to objectively measure the scaliablity of the project, and improving [the "scaling up" experience](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/#scaling-up) for end users.

## Meetings
SIG Scalability meetings are held on the second and forth Wednesday of each month. Meetings can be found in the [Argo Project public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=argoproj%40gmail.com).

The group can also be found on [the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/), in the `#argo-sig-scalability` channel.
