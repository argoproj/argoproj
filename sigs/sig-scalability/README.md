# Argo SIG Scalability

Argo SIG Scalability is focused on the scalability and performance of the Argo projects.

The initial focus of the group is on Argo CD, working through the [the Argo CD Scalability Benchmarking proposal](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/12662). When the time comes that other's want to join and focus on another project (e.g. Argo Workflows), [a proposal](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/master/proposals) should be created to expand the scope of the SIG.

The goals of this group are to create benchmarking tooling to objectively measure the scaliablity of the projects, and improving [the "scaling up" experience](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/#scaling-up) for end users.

## Meetings
SIG Scalability meetings are held on the second and forth Wednesday of each month. Meetings can be found in the [Argo Project public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=argoproj%40gmail.com).

The group can also be found on [the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/), in the `#argo-sig-scalability` channel.
