# Argo SIG Scalability

Argo SIG Scalability is focused on the scalability and performance of the Argo projects.

The initial focus of the group is on Argo CD, working through the [the Argo CD Scalability Benchmarking proposal](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/12662). The time may come to extend the focus onto another project (e.g. Argo Workflows). This will be determined by the members of the SIG.

The goals of this group are to create benchmarking tooling to objectively measure the scaliablity of the projects, and improving [the "scaling up" experience](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/#scaling-up) for end users.

## Meetings
SIG Scalability meetings are held on the second and forth Wednesday of each month. Meetings can be found in the [Argo Project public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=argoproj%40gmail.com).

The members of the group can be contacted on [the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/), in the `#argo-sig-scalability` channel and by using [the `type:scalability` label](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%3Ascalability) on PRs and issues.
