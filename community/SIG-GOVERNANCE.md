# Argo SIG Governance

## Core Principles

### Transparency
What decisions were made, how the decisions were made, and who made the decisions should be a matter of public record.

### Inclusion
Decisions must be made in the best interests of the community and should reflect its viewpoints and be aligned with project goals.

### Accountability
SIGs are held accountable to the Maintainers.

## Governing Rules

* Each SIG must have a secretary/coordinator, whose appointment must be approved by the Maintainers each year. It is not required for the secretary/coordinator to be a maintainer. 
* Each SIG may define additional roles and responsibilities. Roles appointments must be reviewed and approved by the Maintainers each year.
* Each SIG must conduct a quarterly review of their past and planned activities with the Maintainers. 
* Meetings should be open to the community unless there is a specific reason for keeping it private.
* Meeting recordings and/or minutes should be published within 24 hours of the meeting.
For embargoed decisions, the decisions must be made public as soon as the embargo is lifted.

### Creation

* A new SIG could be in the formation phase by sharing the proposal with the maintainer meeting and receiving unanimous agreement in the maintainer meeting.
* A new SIG formation phase should last for more than 3 months and also meet the following milestones:

  * The formation SIG has a clear and actionable goal defined
  * The formation SIG has interested members from at least 3 organizations
  * The formation SIG has conducted several (3+) routine meetings to make substantial progress in its agenda
* After the formation phase, the formation SIG team should present to the maintainer meeting about the current progress. 
* The unanimous agreement among maintainers could turn the formation SIG into the official SIG. With any disagreement, the proposed SIG will remain in the formation phase.

### Deprecation

* The maintainer meeting should review SIGs each quarter for their activities in the maintainer meeting.
* The maintainer meeting should deprecate SIGs with no reasonable activities in the past 6 months. The unanimous agreement among maintainers could reinstall a deprecated SIG.
