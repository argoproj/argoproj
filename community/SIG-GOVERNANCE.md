# Argo SIG Governance

## Core Principles

### Transparency
What decisions were made, how the decisions were made, and who made the decisions should be a matter of public record.

### Inclusion
Decisions must be made in the best interests of the community and should reflect its viewpoints and be aligned with project goals.

### Accountability
SIGs are held accountable to the Maintainers.

## Governing Rules

* Each SIG must have a secretary/coordinator, whose appointment must be approved by the Maintainers each year. It is not required for the secretary/coordinator to be a maintainer. 
* Each SIG may define additional roles and responsibilities. Roles appointments must be reviewed and approved by the Maintainers each year.
* Each SIG must conduct a quarterly review of their past and planned activities with the Maintainers. 
* Meetings should be open to the community unless there is a specific reason for keeping it private.
* Meeting recordings and/or minutes should be published within 24 hours of the meeting.
For embargoed decisions, the decisions must be made public as soon as the embargo is lifted.
