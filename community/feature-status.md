# Feature Status

This document describes the different status a given feature can have in Argo projects.

## Overview

Argo umbrella projects are maintained by the open-source communitity. This means that features are provided by different companies with different use-cases. While certain features are battle tested by corporations with large infrastructure, this is not always the case. Feature status is a classification that can be used by Argo projects to clarify and set expectations about a given functionality. However, not every feature will have to be associated with a given status. Maintainers will use this classification as a framework and gradually associate features with the proper current status. When available, the current status will be informed in the documentation of that specific feature.

## Definition

Argo projects adopt the standard software lifecycle terminology to define the different feature statuses:

- alpha
