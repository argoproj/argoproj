Most of the community discussions happen in the Argo related CNCF Slack channels. You can join [here](https://slack.cncf.io/).

## Projects

Argo is organized into a set of projects. Each project has at least one lead. The leads are responsible for driving the project, publishing a roadmap, organizing community meetings, publishing meeting notes, and reporting on the current status of the project.

The projects are:

* [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) - Declarative GitOps Continuous Delivery
* [Argo Events](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events) - Event-based Dependency Manager
* [Argo Workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows) - Container-native Workflow Engine
* [Argo Rollouts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts) - Progressive Delivery with support for Canary and Blue Green deployment strategies

## Community Meetings

Approvers and leads for each project are responsible for organizing regular community meetings to provide status updates and solicit feedback.

* Meeting agendas should be published at least one week prior to the meeting.
* Community members should be able to attend the meetings remotely.
* Meeting notes summarizing the meeting and any decisions made should be published
within 24 hours of the meeting.
* Meeting recordings should be published within one week of the meeting.
