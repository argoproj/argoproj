## Allow non-coding reviewers

### Date

2021 May 21

### Context

As the Argo Community has grown, we now have significant contributors who are not coders (e.g. designers, product managers, and product marketing). We would like to formally recognize their role and participation in the Argo Community.

### Decision

Argo approvers may assign the role of reviewer to  non-coding contributors who actively contribute and play a significant role in the community.

### Rationale

The Argo Community will benefit by allowing non-coding contributors (e.g. designers, product managers, and product marketing) who actively contribute to the Argo Project to have an official role in the community.

### Dissenting Opinions

None.

## Revise Argo CLA to follow CNCF guidelines

### Date

2020 Sep 19

### Context

Now that the Argo Project is a part of the CNCF, we should revise the Argo CLA to follow CNCF guidelines.

### Decision

We will move from the current Argo Individual and Corporate CLAs to the DCO.
https://github.com/apps/dco/
https://developercertificate.org/

### Rationale

CNCF provides support for implementing both the DCO and CLA. Choice of one over the other is left to each CNCF project. Neither is currently viewed as providing stronger legal protection than the other.

The Linux kernal as well as most CNCF projects use the DCO. The DCO is viewed as a more developer-friendly alternative to the CLA.

### Dissenting Opinions

None.

### Approvers
* Ben Browning (Red Hat)
* Edward Lee (Intuit)

* Mike Bowen (BlackRock)

## Argo Decision Making Process

### Date
2020 Sep 14

### Context

This documents the basic principles for decision making in the Argo Project, particularly by the bootstrap committee and in the future, by the steering and technical oversight committees, to promote transparency, community participation and better decision making.

### Decisions and Rationales

1) Decisions are made based on consensus (unanimous consent).

Consensus promotes an inclusive consideration of all viewpoints, particularly those voiced by a minority of community members compared with alternative decision making processes such as voting. Consensus means that everyone agrees to try a particular course of action, even though as an individuals, one may feel that this may not be the best choice (dissenting opinion).

2) Decisions should reflect the viewpoints of the broader community and encourage community participation in the decision making process.

The highest goal of the Argo Project is to serve the needs of the contributors and users of the Argo Community. The best way to guarantee this is to ensure transparency and community participation in the decision making process.

3) Important decisions should be documented and published, including the context of the decision, the decision that was made, the rationale for the decision, dissenting opinions, and who were responsible for making the decision,

Documenting and publishing decisions results in greater transparency, participation by the community, and understanding of the decisions.

### Dissenting Opinions

None.
