Welcome to Argo Project Onboarding! 

Before submitting the ticket please ensure you understand which [projects](../../community/ecosystem-projects.md) could be added to the Argo community and what the open decision-making process looks like. 

Once you are ready, please help the reviewer understand your project better by 
answering the following questions in your onboarding proposal:

- [ ] What is your project repository Github URL?
- [ ] Do you wish to host your project repository https://github.com/argoproj-labs or https://github.com/argoproj ?
- [ ] Does your project focus on enhancing or providing additional features to one of the existing [core
 projects](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj#what-is-argoproj) ? If yes, which of the core projects is your proposed project related to?
- [ ] Is it endorsed by any of the Argo subproject maintainers? Please mention sponsors from the subproject.
- [ ] How does it align with the goals of the Argo community?
- [ ] Who will maintain the project going forward?

If you have chosen to propose your project for the https://github.com/argoproj Github org:

- [ ] Please explain how tightly related it is to one of the core projects?
- [ ] Is your project ready? Describe the current user and contributor community (size, activity level, etc.). If you are starting the new project, would you consider contributing the project to https://github.com/argoproj-labs initially.
