## Reporting Vulnerabilities

In general, we kindly ask you for responsible disclosure of any security
vulnerabilities you may have found in one of our projects. Please do not create
a GitHub issue, but instead contact us via e-mail at the following address:

* cncf-argo-security@lists.cncf.io

We also kindly ask you to allow us some time for analysing the report and react
on it. We will get in contact with you as soon as possible.

## Public Disclosure

Please refer to the sub-projects' dedicated security policies (see above) for
specific details on how we handle reported vulnerabilities, public disclosure,
crediting and other information.
