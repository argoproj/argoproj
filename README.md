# Argoproj - Get stuff done with Kubernetes

![Argo Image](docs/assets/argo.png)

## News

Argo Project is moving from CLA to DCO as a more contributor friendly way to track contributions.
* https://github.com/apps/dco/

Please start signing off your contributions by doing ONE of the following:
* Use `git commit -s ...` with each commit to add the signoff or
* Manually add a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>` to each commit message.

The email address must match your primary GitHub email. You do NOT need cryptographic (e.g. gpg) signing.
* Use `git commit -s --amend ...` to add a signoff to the latest commit, if you forgot.

## What is Argoproj?

Argoproj is a collection of tools for getting work done with Kubernetes.
* [Argo Workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) - Container-native Workflow Engine
* [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) - Declarative GitOps Continuous Delivery
* [Argo Events](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events) - Event-based Dependency Manager
* [Argo Rollouts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts) - Progressive Delivery with support for Canary and Blue Green deployment strategies

Also [argoproj-labs](https://github.com/argoproj-labs) is a separate GitHub org that we setup for community contributions related to the Argoproj ecosystem. Repos in argoproj-labs are administered by the owners of each project. Please reach out to us on the Argo slack channel if you have a project that you would like to add to the org to make it easier to others in the Argo community to find, use, and contribute back.
